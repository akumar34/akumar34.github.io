{"name":"Project 3: Right Here, Right Now","tagline":"CS 424 Project","body":"# Right Here, Right Now\r\n\r\nThis is the third and final project for CS 424 Fall 2014 under Professor Andrew Johnson. We are going to take a look at live data from the Chicago area, integrating a variety of sources onto a single leaflet map to help users make decisions about their travel plans. Projects 1 and 2 enabled their users to look for interesting features or trends in older data; the idea here is to give the user more timely data in order to make decisions. Right now we can get real-time weather, real-time automobile traffic, information on bike availability, etc. How can that data be integrated to allow the user to make more informed choices for how they want to get from point A to point B.\r\n\r\n## Team Members\r\n\r\nCarlos Ortega<br />\r\nNicholas Bessinas<br />\r\nBryan Spahr<br />\r\nAbhinav Kumar\r\n\r\n## Weekly Status\r\n\r\nPlease click <a href=\"report\">here</a> to see the weekly contribution\\status of each team member.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
