	  		<h2><a name="team-members" class="anchor" href="#team-members"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Overview</h2>
			Project 3 is a data visualization application on real-time feeds of Chicago 3-11 data (potholes, abandoned vehicles, etc.), CTA Bus Tracker data, and Divvy Bike data. On this page, we will describe API's used to retrieve the data, the refresh data rates, and optimization design decisions for enabling the application to handle the approximately 30,000 data points loaded and refreshed.
			
	  		<h2><a name="team-members" class="anchor" href="#team-members"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API's\External Services</h2>
			<li><strong>Socrates Open Data API (SODA)</strong> allows you to programmatically access the Chicago Data Portal, which contains a majority of the datasets that we included in our application. On each call, up to 5,000 rows can be retrieved.</li>
			<li><strong>Bus Tracker API</strong> tracks all of the routes in the city and from the routes, the buses are found for each route and displayed on the map (for a selected shape\region). No more than roughly 7 requests can be made to the bus tracker per hour.</li>
			<li><strong>dbpediaLayer Library\API for Wikipedia</strong> accesses Wikipedia to provide wiki descriptions about interesting locations in Chicago.
			<img src="images/projectdata_wikipedia.jpeg"></img></li>
			<li><strong>yahooapis</strong> is an interface to the Yahoo Query Language (YQL) that allows you to query data from APIs (such as SODA API, the Divvy Bikes data, etc). The biggest benefit is even if cross-domain (that is, jsonp) is not supported, yahooapis acts as a json proxy.
			
	  		<h2><a name="team-members" class="anchor" href="#team-members"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Datasets</h2>
			The following provides a description of each of the datasets used in the application.

				<tr><td>Dataset</td><td>Description</td><td>API</td><td>Refresh Rate (Seconds)</td></tr>

				<tr><td>Abandoned Vehicles</td><td>A car is considered abandoned if it's irrepairable, it's deserted, or it's hazardous</td><td>SODA</td><td>130</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Street Lights</td><td>An outage of at least 1 street light out on a street.</td><td>SODA</td><td>140</tr>
				<tr><td>Crime</td><td>These are reported crimes (with the exception of murder) occurring since 2001.</td><td>SODA</td><td>100</tr>
				<tr><td>Divvy Bike Stations</td><td>Lists the current status (in service vs out of service, available docks, etc) for each station.</td><td>JSON</td><td>80</tr>

	  		<h2><a name="team-members" class="anchor" href="#team-members"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Design</h2>
			We now discuss the design details of each of our datasets.
			<li><strong>Potholes</strong> required 6,000 rows (that is, 2 calls, one for 5,000 rows and a subsequent call for 1,000 more rows) in order to obtain 1 1 month full of data. Also, the potholes with status of 'Completed' and 'Completed - Dup' are excluded as the user only should care about those potholes that are still open. Finally, note the slow refresh rate (120 seconds) primarily because this data will not change that much in that time anyways.</li>
			<li><strong>Abandoned Vehicles</strong> required 3,000 rows (that is, 1 call for 3,000 rows) in order to obtain 1 month full of data. Also, the abandoned vehicles with status of 'Completed' and 'Completed - Dup' are excluded as the user only should care about those potholes that are still open. Finally, note the slow refresh rate (140 seconds) primarily because this data will not change that much in that time anyways.</li>			
			<li><strong>Street Lights</strong> required 3,000 rows (that is, 1 call for 3,000 rows) in order to obtain 1 month full of data. Also, the abandoned vehicles with status of 'Completed' and 'Completed - Dup' are excluded as the user only should care about those potholes that are still open. Finally, note the slow refresh rate (140 seconds) primarily because this data will not change that much in that time anyways.</li>	
			
			<li><strong>Potholes, Abandoned Vehicles, Street Lights, Crime, and Food Inspection</strong> are all 311 data, meaning that they are found in the Chicago Data Portal and accessible using SODA API. Note that two datasets are applied for street lights (1-2 street lights out and 3 or more street lights out datasets). Also note that
