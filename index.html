      <p>

      <b><strong>Right Here, Right Now</strong></b> is the second project in the course <b><strong>CS 424: Visualization and Visual Analytics</strong></b> under Prof. Andrew Johnson at University of Illinois at Chicago(UIC). We are going to take a look at live data from the Chicago area, integrating a variety of sources onto a single leaflet map to help users make decisions about their travel plans. Projects 1 and 2 enabled their users to look for interesting features or trends in older data; the idea here is to give the user more timely data in order to make decisions. Right now we can get real-time weather, real-time automobile traffic, information on bike availability, etc. How can that data be integrated to allow the user to make more informed choices for how they want to get from point A to point B.
      <br>
      <br>
      Using visualization techniques, we are trying to visualize the Divvy Bike Sites on a zoomable and pannable map of Chicago which allows the user to interact with the application and go to the level of depth he/she desires. Alongside displaying the divvy sites, we are exploring the demographics, flow and patterns of usage of the Divvy Bike Sharing Service.

      <br>
      <br>
      The Techniques used majorly are two Javascript libraries listed below:
      <br>
          <h4>1. D3 </h4>
          This javascript library has been used to visualize Divvy Bike Site and Usage Data as Bar Charts, Line Charts and Pie Charts which was one of the main requirements of the project. This has been extensively used to show various visualizations showing overall city data and filter it down to various characteristics like demographics, subscriber vs customer, age groups.
          <br><br>
          <h4>2. Leaflet </h4>
          This javascript library has been used to display the zoomable and pannable map of Chicago along with multiple views and multiple layers based on various parameters. Using leaflet, we created different layers such as popularity layer, stations layer and community layer which allows the user to filter or add unique characteristics. These layers also have popups which help one identify and add characteristics to the visualization.
